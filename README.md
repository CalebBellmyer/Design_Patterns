# Design Patterns

 **Design Patterns** are blueprints to solve common coding problems. They are more like strict pseudo code solutions. These patterns generally work in any  language.

design patterns formal description 
 - Intent 
	 - Describes problem and solution
 - Motivation
	 - explains the solution that this pattern makes possible
 - Structure
	 -  shows each part of pattern and how they are related to others
 - Code Example
	 - Popular programming language example



# Types of Patterns

Creational Patterns 
- Provide object creation mechanisms (increases flexibility and reuses existing code)
Structural Patterns
- Explain how to assemble objects and classes into bigger structures while maintaining flexibility and efficiency
Behavioral Patterns
- Communication and Assignment of responsibilities between objects


# Criticisms

1. Weak programming language
	language lacks the abstraction needed to easily implement features
2. Inefficient solutions
	May not be the most optimal solution
3. Unjustified uses
	Just because the pattern exists does not mean it should be used
